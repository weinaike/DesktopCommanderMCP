# PostHog Analytics Integration - Team Review Guide

## 🎯 Quick Summary
We've added PostHog analytics alongside our existing Google Analytics to provide advanced user behavior tracking, funnel analysis, and A/B testing capabilities for the Desktop Commander landing page.

## 🔍 What to Review

### Key Files Changed
1. **`docs/index.html`** (lines ~60-90): PostHog SDK integration
2. **`docs/js/analytics-tracking.js`** (extensive enhancements): Dual tracking functionality

### Safety Features ✅
- **Production-only tracking**: PostHog only activates on desktopcommander.app
- **Zero GA interference**: All existing Google Analytics functionality preserved
- **Privacy-compliant**: EU hosting, GDPR-friendly settings
- **Performance optimized**: Async loading, DNS preconnect

## 📊 New Analytics Capabilities

### User Journey Tracking
```javascript
// Example: Track complete installation funnel
installation_funnel {
  step: "method_selected",
  method: "Docker Install", 
  success: true,
  funnel_stage: "method_selected_Docker Install",
  step_number: 4
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
```javascript
// Example: Core Web Vitals tracking
performance_metric {
  metric_name: "fid",
  metric_value: 304,
  context: "core_web_vital"
}
```

### Enhanced User Engagement
```javascript
// Example: Scroll depth tracking
user_engagement {
  milestone: "scroll_depth",
  details: "50%",
  scroll_depth: 50,
  time_on_page: 41
}
```
